## Abstract         

Recent studies have explored leveraging the world knowledge and cognitive capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address the long-tail problem in end-to-end autonomous driving. However, existing methods typically formulate trajectory planning as a language modeling task, where physical actions are output in the language space, potentially leading to issues such as format-violating outputs, infeasible actions, and slow inference speeds. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, a novel **Re**inforced **Cog**nitive framework for end-to-end autonomous **Driv**ing, unifying driving understanding and planning by integrating an autoregressive model with a diffusion planner. First, to instill human driving cognition into the VLM, we introduce a hierarchical data pipeline that mimics the sequential cognitive process of human drivers through three stages: generation, refinement, and quality control. Building on this cognitive foundation, we then address the language-action mismatch by injecting the VLM's learned driving priors into a diffusion planner to efficiently generate continuous and stable trajectories. Furthermore, to enhance driving safety and reduce collisions, we introduce a Diffusion Group Relative Policy Optimization (DiffGRPO) stage, reinforcing the planner for enhanced safety and comfort. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that ReCogDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, qualitative results across diverse driving scenarios and DriveBench highlight the model's scene comprehension. Code and models are available at [ReCogDrive GitHub Repository](https://github.com/xiaomi-research/recogdrive).

Our ReCogDrive is pretrained on 12 open-source driving datasets. For most of these datasets, we leveraged Qwen2.5VL-72B to re-annotate the answers, applied standardized scoring, and filtered them to obtain 12 high-quality QA datasets. In addition, we built an automated annotation pipeline on Navsim, generating 752k QA pairs. These resources enable VLMs to better adapt to driving scenarios. **If you only want to train a VLM for planning on a specific dataset, you can use just that dataset’s trajectories and QA (for example, NAVSIM-Traj and NAVSIM-ReCogDrive) to train the VLM and then perform planning; this can achieve results close to training on the full dataset. We perform large-scale pretraining to improve the VLM’s understanding across diverse driving scenarios.**

We open-sourced these high-quality driving QA datasets in the hope of supporting research on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for driving. If the official maintainers of any dataset prefer that we do not release the JSON annotations, we will remove them immediately. Please note that if you use these datasets, you must comply with the original licenses of the respective datasets. We emphasize that our usage of these datasets is solely for academic research purposes, with no commercial applications involved.

In addition, we provide training data on Bench2Drive, where we further fine-tune our models on mixed data and Navsim real-world scenarios, followed by training on Bench2Drive-Traj and Bench2Drive-QA to better adapt to the CARLA driving environment.

  This visualization demonstrates the driving capabilities of <b>ReCogDrive</b> across diverse scenarios in both real-world settings and the CARLA-simulated Bench2Drive environment. The results show that our model can handle complex maneuvers such as lane following, turning, and interacting with traffic signs, reflecting strong adaptability to various driving contexts.
